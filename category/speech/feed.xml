      <description>Here is the subtitle:
We meet in a week that could change the United Kingdom for ever. Indeed, it could end the United Kingdom as we know it. On Thursday, Scotland votes, of the future of our country is at stake. On Friday, people could be living in a different country with a different place in the world and the different future ahead of it. This is the decision that could break up our family of nations and rips Scotland from rest of the United Kingdom.</description>
