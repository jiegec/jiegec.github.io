   <content type="html">Finally the end of Senior 2 arrives. I'm on the way to Senior 3.
The summer vacation is rather short which is really common
in China. These days I have been diving into Emacs by subscribing
both emacs and emacs-devel mailing list. It contributes to my
English as well. I can learn a lot of new words and expression
thanks to the nice and convenient feature of looking up a word
in iOS.

   <id>https://jiegec.me/programming/2016/02/15/good-software-engineering-rules</id>
   <content type="html">I saw a great saying:

No code runs faster than no code.

No code has fewer bugs than no code.

No code uses less memory than no code.

No code is easier to understand than no code.

It comes from [here](http://www.mikeperham.com/2016/02/09/kill-your-dependencies/).

And i strongly recommends [this article](https://medium.com/@yelouafi/from-callback-to-future-functor-monad-6c86d9c16cb5) for a better understanding of monads.</content>
