   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Finally the end of Senior 2 arrives. Iâ€™m on the way to Senior 3.
The summer vacation is rather short which is really common
in China. These days I have been diving into Emacs by subscribing
both emacs and emacs-devel mailing list. It contributes to my
English as well. I can learn a lot of new words and expression
thanks to the nice and convenient feature of looking up a word
in iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
